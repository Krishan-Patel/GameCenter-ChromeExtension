The motivation behind this project originally was to create an extension that allowed me to keep track of sports scores during the NBA and NHL playoff bubbles last summer during the pandemic. At that time there were a lot of games going on at the same time and I found it inconvenient to have to check each games score individually so I create a solution. From there the extension has evolved to supporting 7 different sports leagues, providing additional statitics and allows users the ability to customize their experience and sync their preferences to their chrome account.
